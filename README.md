## My task

My task for this homework was the following: 
* Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

* Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

* Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
