# Description

This app allows the user to search for books through the Google Books API. Once the user has logged in or signed up the user can save books and the user is able to see the saved book in the my books section. 

My tasks for this app were the following: 

* Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful APIs.

* Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

* Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server
